# Building my Portfolio

I don't know if this is considered "tech" blog but I'd write it anyway.

** Little intro here: **
I am a web developer. I've worked with websites back in my college. From wordpress, to codeigniter with MVC architecture to ReactJS now. I've been in the industry since 2015 but I've never really taken creating my portfolio seriously. I was landing on jobs anyway. Not until recently.

My wife had this drive to create her own blog. She had always wanted to but like me, never got the time until now. She had sleepless nights and watching her complete it filled me with joy.

Seeing my wife create her own [blog CMS](https://demo-cms.jeanaica.com/) challenged me to start building my portfolio. I wanted to do it for the longest time but I don't really had the motivation to start it. Well, as you can see on [my site](https://narnia1991.github.io), it's really lacking that motivation ðŸ˜….

### The Plan

I was planning on creating my website with a proper domain but I decided it to do on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Not just because it's free. I wanted to be the senior that I needed when I was starting out. I don't want to give the young ones "just buy a domain" or "just buy a hosting server" as the first option when they want to create their portfolio. Yes, github pages have limitations but let's use the free method first and see if it's fit to our initial requirements.

### The Development

I planned to do it like a proper Portfolio with a dashboard but I decided to create it as "text only" first. I am a troll, there's no denying it. I am just linking my works on this site. I am planning to host all of it on gh-pages as long as it's capable.

### The Deployment

So far, I've deployed the page, the blog and the presentation that we did when we talked on a college here in the Philippines.

### Not Just Another Portfolio

Most of my ideas were inspired by [my very smart and beautiful wife](https://github.com/jeanaica). So I also created my github readme. I saw hers and I asked how she did it. Apparently there's this [Github Profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) where you can edit what people see when they visit your github profile.

Some of the tools I used were [Profile Technology Icons](https://github.com/marwin1991/profile-technology-icons) by [marwin1991](https://github.com/marwin1991) and [Github Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) by [Anurag](https://github.com/anuraghazra/).

### Others

I'm also trying to make my github activity greener, commiting to even 30 minutes of coding everyday. I plan on doing this for a year and see if I want to continue it afterwards.
